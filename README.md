# MNIST-GAN
This Repository contains my implementations of a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) trained on the MNIST Image Recognition Dataset. 
All three implementations were built and trained entirely in Numpy without the aid of Tensorflow/Keras or Pytorch. The file titled MNIST GAN Perfect is the final version of my model
and the resolution of the generated images is much clearer on this version than on previous versions.
